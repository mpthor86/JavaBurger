# JavaBurger
This is a single page app that uses only JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. Inside the seed file there is a couple burgers, You can view and edit the ingredients of those burgers.

## Install
To use the app run bundle install in your terminal. This app is setup with frontend and backend in one, you will have to cd into the backend folder on the command line. Next migrate with rails db:migrate. Last, rails db:seed to get the burgers to mess around with.

## Running the App
While still in the backend folder you can start the server with rails s.  If on a Mac you can open another terminal and cd out of the backend folder to the main app file and use open index.html.  If on Windows right click index.html and reveal in explorer then double click the index.html file.
